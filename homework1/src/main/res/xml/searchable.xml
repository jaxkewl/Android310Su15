</searchable>

    <!--GOTCHA: choose searchSuggestAuthority to populate the selectionArgs with the query.
                Use searchSuggestIntentAction attribute to define the action of the intent when the user clicks on a
                search suggestion. ACTION_VIEW is commonly used.
                searchSuggestIntentData needs to be included also, so when the user clicks, the row ID of whatever
                was clicked is sent as part of the intent data.
